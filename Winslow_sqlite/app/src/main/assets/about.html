		<div class="title">About the Winslow Tamil dictionary app.</div>
		<div class="p"><p>The Winslow Tamil dictionary app is a product of the
            <a href="http://dsal.uchicago.edu">Digital South Asia Library</a> program (DSAL) at the
            <a href="http://www.uchicago.edu">University of Chicago</a>. The app offers a searchable
            version of Miron Winslow's <i>A comprehensive Tamil and English dictionary of high
            and low Tamil</i> (Madras: P.R. Hunt, 1862).</p>
        </div>
        <div class="p"><p>The Winslow Tamil dictionary can be used both online and offline. The online
            version interacts with a database that runs remotely on a server at the University of Chicago.
            The offline version uses a database that is created on the Android device upon first download.</p>
            <p>By default, the app operates in the online mode. In order to keep this app a reasonable
            size, the database loaded onto the device is smaller than the database running remotely.
            As a result, functionality in online/offlines modes is slightly different.
            For details, see sections below.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="p"><p>Winslow Tamil allows users to conduct both headword and fulltext queries.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="title">Using the Winslow Tamil dictionary.</div>
        <div class="subtitle">Headword Searching</div>
        <div class="p"><p>To search headwords, first be sure that the "Search headwords only" radio button
            at the bottom is selected. Then touch the search box at the top (magnifying glass icon)
            to expose the on-screen keyboard and begin searching. Headwords can be entered in Tamil,
            accented latin characters, and unaccented latin characters. For example, headword searches
            for உபாகமம், <i>upākamam</i>, or <i>upakamam</i> will all yield a definition about
            "a class of books secondary to the Agamas."</p>
        </div>
        <div class="subtitle">Fulltext Searching</div>
        <div class="p"><p>For fulltext searching, select the "Search all text" radio button at the bottom,
            then enter the search term in the search box at the top. In online mode, the app will
            look for the search term throughout the entire database, in headwords and definitions alike. In
            offline mode, fulltext searches only run on the definitions. Thus, in offline mode, a fulltext
            search for <i>upākamam</i> will not yield a result because this term occurs only as a headword,
            and not in a definition.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="subtitle">Results Display</div>
        <div class="p"><p>Search results come first in a numbered list that displays the Tamil headword,
            the accented latin transliteration of the headword, and a chunk of the definition. To see a
            full definition, touch the list item.</p>
            <p>The full result page presents definitions in a format
            that allows the user to select terms to copy and paste for further dictionary searching
            or for conducting a web search on the term (given an internet connection). In online mode,
            the full result page also has a page number link that the user can click to get the full
            page context of the definition. Link arrows at the top of the full page allow the user to
            click to previous and next pages in the dictionary.</p>
	    <p>In online mode, the user can also choose to see results definitions fully transliterated.
            In the overflow menu (either the three vertical dots icon at the top right corner of the screen or,
            on older Samsung devices, the menu hardware key at the bottom left of the device),
            simply click "Transliterated display." In offline mode, this option will disappear from the
            menu, as the offline mode does not support this functionality.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="subtitle">Selecting Online/Offline Mode</div>
	<div class="p"><p>To select either online or offline mode, simply check or uncheck the "Search offline"
            box in the overflow menu. When in online mode, the world icon at the top of the screen will appear dark;
            in offline mode, it will appear light.</p>
            <p>Note that on start up, the app will test to see whether the device has an internet connection and the
            remote server is available. Again, the app operates in online mode by default. The user should
            select the appropriate mode before conducting a search.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="subtitle">Comments</div>
        <div class="p"><p>To offer comments or suggestions about this dictionary app, either go to the
            <a href="http://dsal.uchicago.edu">DSAL web page</a> or send an email to <a href="mailto:dsal@uchicago.edu">
